        <h2>Early Life</h2>
		<p>Nikola Tesla was born on July 10, 1856, in Smiljan, Croatia. He was the fourth of five children in his family. His father, Milutin Tesla, was a Serbian Orthodox priest, and his mother, Djuka Mandic, was Croatian. Tesla's family was of Serbian. <br>

            Tesla showed an aptitude for engineering and science at an early age. He was fascinated by mechanical devices and spent much of his childhood experimenting with them. When Tesla was 12 years old, he built his first machine, a small water wheel, which was powered by a nearby stream. <br>
            
            In 1875, Tesla enrolled at the Austrian Polytechnic in Graz, Austria, where he studied physics and mathematics. He was an exceptional student, but he struggled with the language barrier and was eventually forced to drop out due to financial difficulties. <br>
            
            After leaving Graz, Tesla worked as a draftsman for several years before moving to the United States in 1884. It was there that he began his career as an inventor and scientist, and where he made many of his most significant contributions to science and technology..</p>

		<h2>Career</h2>
		<p>Nikola Tesla's career as an inventor and scientist spanned several decades, during which he made numerous contributions to the fields of electrical engineering, physics, and electromagnetism. Here are some of his most significant achievements: <br>

            Alternating Current (AC) Electrical System: Tesla's most important contribution was his work on the AC electrical system. He developed a motor that ran on AC power, which was more efficient and practical than the DC motors that were in use at the time. He also designed the AC transformer, which allowed for the efficient transmission of electrical power over long distances. <br>
            
            Tesla Coil: In 1891, Tesla invented the Tesla coil, a device used for generating high-voltage, low-current electricity. The Tesla coil was a key component in the development of radio and television technology. <br>

            Wireless Communication: Tesla also worked on wireless communication, developing a system for transmitting radio signals over long distances. He claimed to have invented radio before Guglielmo Marconi, although this claim is still a subject of debate. <br>
            
            X-rays: Tesla also made important contributions to the development of X-ray technology. He conducted experiments using X-rays and helped to develop methods for producing high-frequency currents that were necessary for the generation of X-rays. <br>
            
            Robotics: Tesla also explored the field of robotics, developing a remote-controlled boat and designing a prototype for a humanoid robot. <br>
            
            Tesla was a prolific inventor, holding over 300 patents for his inventions. His work laid the foundation for many of the technologies that we use today, and he is still remembered as one of the greatest inventors of all time..</p>
		<h2>Legacy</h2>
		<p>Tesla's contributions to science and technology have had a lasting impact on the world. He is considered one of the most important inventors of the modern era, and his work continues to inspire and influence scientists and inventors today.Serbian-American engineer and physicist Nikola Tesla (1856-1943) made dozens of breakthroughs in the production, transmission and application of electric power. He invented the first alternating current (AC) motor and developed AC generation and transmission technology.</p>
